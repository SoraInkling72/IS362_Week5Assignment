In general, the northernmost value would be the highest latitude ('lat') value in its series. So, I had to sort the DataFrame by the latitude series with descending values, so that they would be ordered from the highest value to the lowest value. By sorting the DataFrame this way, as well as having it display the first five rows, I would read the top row and see the airport name with the highest latitude value, indicating that it's the northernmost airport in the United States."

I cannot use the same method for when finding the northernmost aiport, as longitudes can be either a positive or a negative number when marking coordinates east (positive) or west (negative) from the prime meridian. And since the values can go up to either 360 or -360, it can represent either a eastern or western coordinate. Though, usually longitiude coordinates go up to 180 or -180 to avoid complications. \n",

    "To workaround this issue, I would have to take into account the correlation of the coordinate system and the timezones. First, I had to create a variable to filter the 'airports' DataFrame based on timezones less than 0, which is reprsented through the series 'tz.' This would reorder them starting from 0 and counting through negative numbers, the easternmost part of the United States has -5 as its timezone value.\n",

    "Based on the information in the DataFrame generated, the easternmost airport in the United States is **Caribou Municipal Airport** in Caribou, Maine. This is because of the correlation of the timezones and longitude, given that the airport's timezone is -5 and has a longitude of 68.017917°W (-68.017917), indicating that it is the easternmost airport in the generated DataFrame. Plus, to reiterate, the easternmost part of the United States is the state of Maine, so with the airport located in the state, it can be concluded that this is the correct answer.\n",

    "Much like determining the easternmost airport of the United States, I would have to apply the same principle when finding which New York area airport had the windiest weather. First, I would have to filter the DataFrame based on New York area airports, being LaGuardia Airport (LGA) and John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK). First, I had to confirm their presence in the CSV file, so I filtered both LGA and JFK in the DataFrame. Sure enough, they were there. Each DataFrame generated having 8706 rows for both airports, indicating that there are 8706 counts of recorded weather data for each airport, for almost every hour each day of the year."
